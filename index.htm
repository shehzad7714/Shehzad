        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio. I am Shehzad Hussain, a seasoned business analyst with a strong focus on leveraging data analysis to drive strategic decision-making and optimise business processes. My career is marked by a commitment to delivering actionable insights, underpinned by robust analytical skills and effective communication. I thrive in dynamic business environments and am passionate about contributing my expertise to facilitate growth and efficiency.

I bring a diverse skill set, including proficiency in Data Analysis, Stakeholder Management, Jira, PowerBI, and MS Office. I am also adept in Design Thinking Methodology, Strategic Thinking/Planning, and thoroughly understand the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). My ability to translate complex technical language into simpler terms has been a key asset in communicating with a varied audience.

My professional journey includes key roles such as a Senior Consultant at Apex Group Ltd, London, where I was instrumental in developing our internal K2 platform, focusing on custom workflows and applications. This role involved significant data extraction, report generation, and managing a new online fund investments platform. As a Graduate Integration Analyst at Pace Integration, London, I demonstrated my capabilities as a certified Snap Logic professional, making substantial contributions to high-profile government projects and enhancing client relations. My tenure as an IT Consultant (Placement Year Intern) at GE Healthcare involved developing innovative solutions for KPI recording and playing a crucial role in a Deloitte Consulting project.

Educationally, I hold a BSc in Computing with Year in Industry from the University of Kent, where I honed my skills in various programming languages and computing concepts. My degree emphasised data analysis, app development, and understanding human-computer interaction, giving me a well-rounded perspective on technology's role in business.

I am dedicated to continuous learning and have enhanced my skills in SQL, cloud-based technologies like MS Azure, and various software tools. My educational background, combined with my diverse professional experiences, has equipped me with a unique blend of technical expertise and practical business acumen, making me a valuable asset to any organisation.</p>
